# share_files_and_screenshot_widgets_plus

## Important

This is the author's library https://pub.dev/packages/share_files_and_screenshot_widgets

I just upgraded it to null safety

This pub lets you share any kind of files (csv, mp4, png etc), take screenshot of the widgets you want and return as Image and share them directly as well in the form of an image.

## Usage

## Example

To use this package :

* add the dependency to your [pubspec.yaml] file.

```yaml
  dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    share_files_and_screenshot_widgets_plus: ^1.0.5
```

### How to use

#### Take ScreenShot of Widgets

```dart
//define
GlobalKey previewContainer = GlobalKey();

//wrap your widget with
RepaintBoundary(
  key: previewContainer,
  child: YourWidget()
),

//call this function for taking screenshot
ShareFilesAndScreenshotWidgets()
    .takeScreenshot(previewContainer, originalSize)
    .then((Image value) {
  setState(() {
    _image = value;
  });
});
```

#### Directly Share ScreenShot of Widgets

```dart
//define
GlobalKey previewContainer = new GlobalKey();

//wrap your widget with
RepaintBoundary(
  key: previewContainer,
  child: YourWidget()
),

//call this function for sharing screenshot
ShareFilesAndScreenshotWidgets().shareScreenshot(
  previewContainer,
  originalSize,
  "Title",
  "Name.png",
  "image/png",
  text: "This is the caption!");
```

#### Share Any Type of File

```dart
ByteData bytes =
    await rootBundle.load('assets/example.jpg');
Uint8List list = bytes.buffer.asUint8List();
ShareFilesAndScreenshotWidgets().shareFile(
    "Title", "Name.jpg", list, "image/jpg",
    text: "This is the caption!");
```
```dart
ByteData bytes =
    await rootBundle.load('assets/example.mp4');
Uint8List list = bytes.buffer.asUint8List();
ShareFilesAndScreenshotWidgets().shareFile(
    "Title", "Name.mp4", list, "video/mp4",
    text: "This is the caption!");
```
```dart
ByteData bytes =
    await rootBundle.load('assets/example.mp3');
Uint8List list = bytes.buffer.asUint8List();
ShareFilesAndScreenshotWidgets().shareFile(
    "Title", "Name.mp3", list, "audio/mp3",
    text: "This is the caption!");
```
